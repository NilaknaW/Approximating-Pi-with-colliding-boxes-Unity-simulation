# Approximating-Pi-with-colliding-boxes-Unity-simulation

This is a simulation project for visualizing the approximation to Pi by counting collisions between boxes. For the 3d physics simulation, Unity3D is used and the project is inspired by the video posted on the 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. The simulation was made for the mathematics department stall at the EXMO 2023 engineering exhibition of the University of Moratuwa. 

If you are interested in the math behind this, please read the math.pdf document.

To run the simulation yourself, download exe files and save them in one folder. Run 'math 2 1.exe' and enjoy!
